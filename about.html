              Now, the Xpulse 200 4V was already a significant upgrade over the 2-valve version. But we were in the hopes that Hero would come up with a rally Kit for the bike. Something that we loved in the previous version as well. In the 2-valve version, the Rally Kit came with longer-travel suspension and more off-road focused tyres and ergonomics, among other things. And now, Hero seems to have something similar in the pipeline for the 4V, but it will have a little more than before.

If youâ€™re among those who want a bespoke package to suit specific needs, then the Rally Kit will be the way to go about it. With the complete package, the motorcycle will be taller and slightly longer, with a longer wheelbase. The package will also add a kilo to the kerb weight adn will retain previous features like the flexibility of suspensions, more off-road friendly tyres, and tweaked ergonomics, courtesy of a new seat and handlebar risers.
